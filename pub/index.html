<br>
<b>NOTE 3 </b> There seems to be some strange signals happening at the left side of the waterfall, probably some mixing from the TS-590.
<br>
Signals can vary due to the antenna-tuner and used antenna as the dongles are connected to my TS-590 for RX-signals, they use the same antenna's as my tranceiver.
